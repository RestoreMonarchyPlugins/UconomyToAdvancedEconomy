# Uconomy To Advanced Economy
Enable all Uconomy plugins to work with Advanced Economy.

If you have **[Advanced Economy](https://restoremonarchy.com/servers/plugins/advancedeconomy)** on your server, you can install this plugin to make all **[Uconomy](https://restoremonarchy.com/servers/plugins/advancedeconomy)**-dependent plugins work with Advanced Economy instead.

This plugin file is named `Uconomy.dll` as it replaces the original `Uconomy.dll` file.

It redirects all calls from plugins like [uPets](https://restoremonarchy.com/servers/plugins/upets), [Kits](https://restoremonarchy.com/servers/plugins/kits), and [Sell Door](https://restoremonarchy.com/servers/plugins/selldoor) that normally use **[Uconomy](https://restoremonarchy.com/servers/plugins/advancedeconomy)** to **[Advanced Economy](https://restoremonarchy.com/servers/plugins/advancedeconomy)** instead.

Remember that you can only use this plugin if you have Advanced Economy installed on your server.
